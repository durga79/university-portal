## 🎯 Features and Security Objectives

### Core Functionalities
- **User Authentication & Authorization** - Secure login with role-based access control (RBAC)
- **Student Management** - CRUD operations for student profiles and enrollment
- **Course Management** - Create, update, and manage courses with capacity limits
- **Attendance Tracking** - Mark and monitor student attendance with percentage alerts
- **Course Materials Library** - Upload/download educational resources (PDFs, slides, videos)
- **Announcements System** - Broadcast important updates to students
- **Bulk Operations** - CSV-based student import for efficiency
- **Audit Logging** - Track all administrative actions for accountability

### Security Improvements Implemented

#### 1. **Authentication Security**
- ✅ Secure password hashing using bcrypt (12 rounds)
- ✅ JWT-based session management with httpOnly cookies
- ✅ Password strength requirements (min 8 chars)
- ✅ Account lockout after failed login attempts
- ✅ Secure session timeout and refresh mechanisms

#### 2. **Authorization & Access Control**
- ✅ Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) - ADMIN and STUDENT roles
- ✅ Middleware-based route protection
- ✅ API endpoint authorization checks
- ✅ Removed public admin registration (admins can only be created by other admins)
- ✅ Principle of least privilege enforcement

#### 3. **Input Validation & Data Sanitization**

- ✅ User tracking (who, what, when)
- ✅ IP address and user agent logging
- ✅ Action details stored for compliance

#### 9. **Error Handling**
- ✅ Generic error messages to prevent information disclosure
- ✅ Detailed logging for debugging (server-side only)
- ✅ User-friendly error pages
- ✅ No stack traces exposed in production

#### 10. **Rate Limiting**

## 🧪 Testing Process

### 1. Static Application Security Testing (SAST)

**How to Run SAST Tests:**

```bash
# Check dependencies for vulnerabilities
pnpm run security:audit

# Scan code for security issues
pnpm run lint:security

# Run both checks together
pnpm run sast
```

**Tools Used:**
- **ESLint Security Plugin** - Static code analysis (`pnpm run lint:security`)
- **pnpm audit** - Dependency vulnerability scanning (`pnpm run security:audit`)
- **Prisma Studio** - Database security review

**Key Findings:**
- ✅ No high-severity vulnerabilities in dependencies (0 found)
- ✅ No critical security issues in code (0 found)
- ✅ All user inputs validated with Zod schemas
- ✅ No hardcoded secrets in codebase
- ✅ Secure configuration verified

**Test Results:**
```
Dependency Audit: No known vulnerabilities found ✅
Code Security Scan: No critical security anti-patterns ✅
Status: PASS
```

### 2. Functional Security Testing

#### Test Case 1: SQL Injection Prevention
**Objective**: Verify application is protected against SQL injection  
**Steps**:
1. Attempt to login with `' OR '1'='1` as password
2. Try injecting SQL in search fields
3. Test course enrollment with malicious input

**Result**: ✅ All attempts blocked by Prisma ORM parameterization

#### Test Case 2: Authentication & Authorization
**Objective**: Verify role-based access control  
**Steps**:
1. Student attempts to access `/admin/users`
2. Unauthenticated user tries to access `/student/dashboard`
3. Admin tries to edit another admin's profile

**Result**: ✅ All unauthorized access attempts redirected to `/unauthorized`

#### Test Case 3: XSS Prevention
**Objective**: Verify protection against cross-site scripting  
**Steps**:
1. Inject `<script>alert('XSS')</script>` in announcement content
2. Add `<img src=x onerror=alert(1)>` to student name
3. Test with various XSS payloads

**Result**: ✅ All scripts escaped and rendered as text

### 3. Manual Penetration Testing

**Tests Performed:**
- ✅ Password reset flow security
- ✅ Session fixation attacks
- ✅ CSRF token validation
- ✅ File upload restrictions
- ✅ Brute force protection

**Results**: No critical vulnerabilities found
